* Axiom

An axiom/postulate can be introduced by using the =axiom= keyword.
For example, let us imagine one wants to write a program that assumes
$A$ is a type and there exist a term $x$ that inhabits $A$. Then the program would
like like the following.

#+begin_src
-- Example.mjuvix
module Example;
 axiom A : Type;
 axom x : A;
end;
#+end_src

Terms introduced by the =axiom= keyword lack of any computational content. However,
it is possible to attach a computational content to an axiom by giving compilation rules,
see [[./compile-blocks.md][Compile blocks]].
